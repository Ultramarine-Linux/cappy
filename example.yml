# Example YAML configuration file for using the libcappy installer
#
# This file is part of libcappy.
#
# personal note: it feels like libcappy is just gonna turn into another anaconda/cloud-init now, this time with readable YAML configs instead of some weird kickstart file
# NIH syndrome is real and Ultramarine is the example of it. At least libcappy actually kind of allows more customization than an average kickstart file
