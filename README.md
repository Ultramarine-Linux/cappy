# Cappy
(Not actually named after the author themself, but after a cute nickname for a captain.)

Cappy is a to-be system configuration and management library and tools for Ultramarine Linux (and in extension, Fedora).

It is designed to be a DNF-based alternative to OpenSUSE's YaST2, with a focus on simplicity and pure approachability.

Cappy is planned to have the following features:

* A graphical user interface for managing repositories and packages.
* CLI tools for simplifying package management.
* Graphical Copr frontend, like an app store for community repositories.
* Full-fledged library for system configuration, similar to the one in YaST.
* Integration with DNFStrap, a custom system installer and alternative to Anaconda.* (Potentially)
* Support for RisiOS's RisiScript language.

For any requests, bug reports, or feature requests, please open an issue on this project's repository.
